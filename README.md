# ITC-Week6-Minecraft
This project was an assignment at Israel Tech Challenge 6 weeks into the fullstack development bootcamp, to develop a 2D version of Minecraft and it's landing page, using Javascript.
I worked in pair with ilann0 to make a "MinecraftJS" library. The map is generated randomly at each game, and we used the builder and observer patterns.
